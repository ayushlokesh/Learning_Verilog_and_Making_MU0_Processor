INFO (VLOGNET-188): While generating implicit netlist, it is recommended to set
the Terminal SyncUp option on the Netlist Setup form as 'Honor Switch
Master'.
Alternatively, you can set the hnlVerilogTermSyncUp variable as
'honorSM'.
This option automatically resolves any mismatch between the terminals
of an instance and its switch master while generating an implicit netlist.

INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the

"/home/z86327ag/Cadence/COMP12111/COMP12111_lib/trafficlight/testfixture.verilog" file. To print the stimulus name mapped table, set

simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t either in CIW or the .simrc file

before invoking Verilog netlister.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating
instance ports. To prevent 
them from being printed, set
simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t either in CIW or 
the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-66): Module ports will be printed without the port ranges. If you
have split busses 
across module ports you may get an incorrect netlist. To
print module ports 
with the port ranges, set simVerilogDropPortRange = nil
either in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to
"z". To get inout 
pins with initial state of "0", set
hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
either in CIW or the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-117): Re-netlisting the entire design.

INFO (VLOGNET-120): Using connection by order (implicit connections) for all the
stopping cells.
